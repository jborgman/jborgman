<h2 align="center">Hello there! My name is Josh[ua] Borgman.</h2>

I'm currently an [analytics leader](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jborgman0/) @ Amazon.com, focusing on pricing, evaluation and perception products. I occasionally post on my [website](https://jborgman.github.io/) about random musings, mostly things loosely related to DS/ML, stats, or physics.
